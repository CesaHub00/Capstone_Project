# **Capstone Project**
End of the certificate course [*Google Advanced Data Analitycs*](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics) from Coursera.

In the [project](Capstone_Project.ipynb), the main goal is to analyze the data and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.
The notebook is divided in 4 steps:
  1. Package import and dataset load
  1. Data exploration and visualization
     - Understand the variables
     - Clean the dataset (missing data, redundant data, outliers)
     - Boxplots, scatterplots, histograms and heatmaps
  1. Model building in 2 methods
     - Model approach A: Logistic Regression
     - Model approach B: Tree-based Machine Learning
  1. Results and evaluation
     - Summary of model results
     - Conclusion and next steps
