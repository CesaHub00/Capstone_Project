# **Capstone Project**
The Capstone Project is the end of the certificate course [*Google Advanced Data Analyst*](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics) from coursera that i took.

In the [project](Capstone_Project.ipynb), the main goal is to analyze the data and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company; to do so i used a Logistic Regression model and a Tree-Based Machine Learning model.
